        <p>I am a <strong>developer, technical analyst, and technical customer service specialist.</strong> As a child I used to take things apart and put them back together so that I could help fix things for others. My passion has always been primarily high touch customer service. When I came into the technical world, I realized there is a general vacuum for customer service in IT. I fill that vacuum and thus I have built a fantastic career in tech. Now, I'm at CodingDojo learning to become a developer. The idea that I could do behind the scenes work to make a person's life better when using my software, appeals to me from the customer services perspective, but not from the "behind the scenes" perspective. I love to work directly with our customers because I love the experience of truly listening to their needs. Translating tech into layman terms, and turning layman terms into tech, is my passion. Oh. I also like to ride sport bikes. </p>

                <td>This was a really amazing trip. At the end of the video are some pictures. My friend Royce was on his Ducati and I caught up to him just past the triple tunnels (3 tunnels on Jurrican Ridge). There are 88 turns between the tunnels and the top of Hurrican Ridge. Much of the slow video was cut out. That pavement is engineered very well, that ride is a lot of fun.</td>

                <td>This video was my very first time ever seeing Mt. St. Helens. I decided to make it a tribute video to atmospheric sciences. David Johnston is featured, the geologist / vulcanologist who died on Johnston Ridge during the eruption. I also was very impressed by how well engineered this road is. There is no trace of human life past a certain point as you approach Mt. St. Helens. Everthing is new, well, less than 30 years old.</td>

				<td>I got pulled over. Sir, yes sir, sir, no sir... I didn't get a ticket. Generally I don't get good feedback on this video, many people think I got away with this unjustly. Unfortunately, I can clearly see this light was red, and I knew that when I went through it.</td>

				<td>I included this video because it shows what training can do. This was a VERY tense moment. I had to make a correction in a split second. Stay off the front brakes, feather that back brakes, be ready to drop my tire into the dirt. It all happened with no time to think. Training worked. I instantly thought of, don't mash the brakes, feather rear only, hold fog line gently... it paid off. That decision was one of the fastest decision I have ever made. Could've been bad.</td>
